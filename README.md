# Data-Analysis-Projects
This repository contains various data analysis projects I completed using relational databases and spreadsheet software in order to analyze and interpret data. The specific resources I used to analyze data for these projects are SQLite, W3 Schools MySQL Tryit Editor, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
